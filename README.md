# Nicolas Nunes Martins (BR), Espírito Santo - Vila Velha
I study web development and I'm also graduating in Journalism, on the Federal University of Espírito Santo (Ufes). 
A fan of comunication improvements and the debate that surrounds data rights. Whiling to bring debates to the public in general about how technology is not a superpower, but a human labor. Most people imagine that technology is growing by itself, like in Black Mirror, or Matrix. I would like to show, through journalism, that is not quite that. 
I want to learn and contribute to projects as much as I can.

Well, here goes some info about me:

My favorite band is Mukeka de Rato
I love any tipe of animal
Cards and cigarettes
Dark shapes
